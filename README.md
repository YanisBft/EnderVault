# EnderVault
A Minecraft datapack replacing elytra in End Cities with vaults.

### Features

**Ender Vault** is a datapack replacing elytra item frames in End Cities by newly added Vaults.
That way, every player on a server can obtain elytra, without exploring thousands of blocks!

In order to open these Ender Vaults, you need to obtain an **Ender Key**, which is dropped by the Ender Dragon.

This datapack is only compatible with snapshot 24w05a, with "Update 1.21" experimental datapack enabled.
